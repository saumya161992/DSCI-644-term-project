                        The current Multi-Class Prediction Model to predict the recommendation of a text review is
                        fairly inaccurate and does not perform to an acceptable standard. It currently has an accuracy
                        of approximately 60% and tends to be biased towards a specific class.
                        In order to provide better results against inaccurate reviews, a new Multi Class Nerual Network
                        Machine Learning model is presented that will be free of that biasing and will provide predictions with
                        a higher accuracy than the initial model.

                        The major requirement of this project is to provide a new multi-class machine learning model with better
                        accuracy than the current model and to eliminate the biasing in the current model. The proposed implementation
                        will also require a new overall architecture and design, along with the new machine learning model with finer
                        data preprocessing and superior training. Another portion of this implementation is better documentation
                        for the entire system, such as documenting each component of this design, and what steps are needed to
                        obtained the intended results.

                        In order to provide a solution that will fufill the requirements, the whole implementation of the current
                        model will need to be redesigned. Starting with the machine learning model, a new model type will be needed
                        and changes will need to take place as for the training of said model. With the new implementation,
                        the model will be trained with approximately 60-70% of the data set and then tested on the remaining data to
                        validate accuracy. (Probably needs a few more notes here)

						The architecure first includes the process of preprocessing the dataset of Amazon reviews. The data is cleaned and then separated into unique identifiers and the text reviews. The text reviews go through further preprocessing to prepare it to be used in the training of the multi-class model. After the dataset is ready, the model is created and the parameters, such as softmax limits and the number of hidden layers is set. The model is then training using 70% of the dataset and then tested using the remaining 30%. The model's performance and accuracy is then tested and the model is tweaked and refined to achieve the required project requirements.

                        The main tools that are being used to coordinate this project are Slack, Trello, Git, and Microsoft Azure.
                        Slack is used to brainstorm ideas and for communication purposes within the group. With Trello, (Trello Link somewhere)
                        a Project Board is created to manage the overall progress of the project and to ensure that each requirement is assigned
                        to someone so we'll have everything ready for the deliverables. Github is also used to coordinate files and code needed for
                        the project.
